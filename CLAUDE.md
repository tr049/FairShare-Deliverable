## What is Sprint Zero?

Sprint Zero is a cloneable Claude Code kit that turns a reference URL plus three scoping answers into a complete spec set and a working product. The user points Sprint Zero at something similar to what they want to build, answers one multi-part scoping question, and a team of sub-agents produces:

- A full spec set in `docs/` (scope, reference brief, PRD, decisions, user stories, API contract)
- A working build whose stack is chosen at scoping time (see "Build configuration" below) — by default a local SQLite-backed Express + React app that runs with no external account
- QA calibrated to the build — browser-driven for web apps, API-level for services, command runs for CLIs
- A white-hat security pass after QA — auth, authorization (IDOR), injection, and misconfiguration checks against the running build, returned as a report-only findings report

The audience is PMs, founders, and non-developers who can follow terminal output but don't write code. Every decision in this repo prioritises:

- Clarity over cleverness
- Demo-readiness over production hardening
- Visible outputs over elegant internals
- The user's judgement over inferred defaults

---

## Scope levels

The user picks one of three levels up front. The scope level drives every downstream agent's behaviour.

| Level       | What it produces                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `clickable` | Mock backend, fake data, no auth. Useful for pitching and flow reviews.                                           |
| `MVP`       | Real data + real auth via the chosen data layer, one core loop works end-to-end. The main v1 target.              |
| `Prod`      | MVP plus error boundaries, loading states, input validation, and a happy path + one error path test per loop.     |

`docs/scope.md` is the lever that carries this choice — and the build configuration above — through the pipeline. The scope level is independent of the data layer: `clickable` is mock-only regardless, while `MVP`/`Prod` use whichever data layer was chosen.

---

## Build configuration

The build is configured by three orthogonal choices captured during scoping, on top of the scope level. The full catalog — concrete dirs, ports, run commands, and test strategy for every combination — lives in `.claude/stacks.md`, which every agent reads. Do not hardcode a stack assumption anywhere else.

- **Project type** — `web-app` (UI + API), `api-service` (API only, no frontend), or `cli-tool` (a command-line program).
- **Stack profile** — `node-react` (Express + React/Vite), `nextjs` (one Next.js app, UI + API together), or `python-react` (FastAPI + React/Vite).
- **Data layer** — `local` (SQLite + a self-issued JWT, **zero external setup**) or `supabase` (hosted Postgres + Supabase Auth, needs a `.env`).

**Default: `web-app` + `node-react` + `local`.** That default clones and runs with no account, no keys, and no `.env`. Supabase is opt-in. `docs/scope.md` records all three choices and carries them through the pipeline alongside the scope level.

Testing is Playwright (via Playwright MCP) for web apps, HTTP integration tests for API services, and command-output assertions for CLIs.

## Architecture, one line

URL → scoping conversation → spec set (PRD, decisions, stories, contract) → parallel build (backend + frontend) → QA with browser-driven tests → white-hat security pass → working product.

## Agent topology

Sprint Zero's build layer has five sub-agents. One orchestrator, two engineers, one QA, one security tester. The user talks to the orchestrator. The orchestrator handles everything else. Which engineers run depends on the project type — `frontend-engineer` is spawned only for `web-app`. The tail of the sequence is fixed: `qa-engineer` runs once both engineers finish, and `security-engineer` runs last, after QA.

```

### tech-lead

- Reads `docs/scope.md` (scope level + build config), `docs/prd.md`, `docs/api-contract.md`, `docs/decisions.md`, and resolves the config against `.claude/stacks.md`
- Briefs the user on what it understood, including the resolved dirs/ports and which engineers to spawn
- For `web-app`: spawns `backend-engineer` and `frontend-engineer`; for `api-service`/`cli-tool`: backend only
- Waits for the engineers, then spawns `qa-engineer`
- Returns a delivery summary
- Does not write application code

### backend-engineer

- Builds the API (Express / FastAPI / Next.js route handlers) or, for `cli-tool`, a command-line program — per the resolved stack profile
- Data access + auth per the data layer: `local` → SQLite + a self-issued JWT (`/auth/*` endpoints), `supabase` → `@supabase/supabase-js` + JWKS verification
- Seed script creates the schema (SQLite or via migration) and a demo user with realistic data
- Builds strictly to `docs/api-contract.md`

### frontend-engineer (web-app only)

- Builds the UI — React + Vite in `client/`, or pages inside the Next.js `app/`
- Auth per the data layer: `local` → calls the backend `/auth/*`; `supabase` → Supabase Auth SDK. Login, signup, session context, protected route wrapper
- Product screens come from `docs/user-stories.md` and the contract
- Form patterns standardised so QA can drive them

### qa-engineer

- `web-app`: the full auth dance (signup, session, logout, login, protected route, 401) + core loop in a real browser via Playwright
- `api-service`: contract + HTTP integration tests, auth verified at the API level (no browser)
- `cli-tool`: runs the CLI with sample args and asserts on stdout/exit codes
- At `Prod` scope, adds one error-path test per loop. Reports pass/fail back to `tech-lead`

### security-engineer

- Runs **after** `qa-engineer`, as the final validation stage — a white-hat penetration test of the build QA just verified working
- `web-app`: API attacks plus browser-driven checks (stored XSS, client-side token handling) via Playwright; `api-service`: HTTP-level attacks only; `cli-tool`: static review plus argument/injection fuzzing, no network attacks
- Covers broken authentication (forged / `alg:none` tokens), broken object-level authorization (IDOR across tenants), injection (SQLi, XSS), input-validation and business-logic abuse, misconfiguration, and a dependency scan
- Calibrated by scope level: `clickable` is a static pass only; `MVP` adds the dynamic auth, authorization, and injection attacks; `Prod` adds the validation and error-handling abuse cases
- Report-only — writes attack scripts and a severity-rated report under `security/`, never modifies application code. Authorized scope is the local build on localhost only

## Key files Claude Code should read first

When starting a session on this repo, read in this order:

1. `CLAUDE.md` (this file) — project context and rules
2. `plan.md` — what's built, what's next, what's out of scope
3. `README.md` — the public-facing story, to stay consistent with it

When a user invokes `/sprint-zero <url>`, the orchestrator adds:

4. `docs/scope.md` (once scoping is complete)
5. `docs/prd.md`
6. `docs/api-contract.md`
7. `docs/decisions.md`

---

## Rules for all agents

1. **The API contract is law.** `docs/api-contract.md` is the shared interface. Backend implements it. Frontend consumes it. QA validates against it. If it's wrong or missing, stop and flag it — do not work around it silently.
2. **Read the scope file.** `docs/scope.md` tells you which of the three levels you're building for. Calibrate your output to that level. Do not add polish above the chosen level.
3. **Keep files small and readable.** Non-developers will read this. Someone may record a Loom over it.
4. **No TypeScript unless the scope file says so.** Plain JavaScript by default.
5. **No exotic dependencies.** If it needs its own README to install, pick something simpler.
6. **Seed data must be realistic.** Real-sounding names, companies, and records. Not "Test User 1".
7. **Every endpoint returns consistent JSON.** Structure defined in `docs/api-contract.md`.
8. **Log decisions.** If you make a tradeoff, add a line to `docs/decisions.md`.
9. **Narrate handoffs.** Orchestrator and engineers: never go silent for long stretches. The user is watching.
10. **Do less when in doubt.** A working 80% at the chosen scope beats a broken 100%.

## Conventions

- Sentence case for headings in markdown, not Title Case.
- No emoji in technical output.
- Prose over bullet lists unless structure genuinely helps.
- Numbered steps when sequence matters; otherwise prose.
- One idea per paragraph.

---

## Context for Claude Code

- Builder: Yousuf Alvi (co-facilitator on Hamza Farooq's Claude Code for PMs cohort)
- Audience for this repo: PMs and non-developers using Claude Code
- This repo's own build is tracked in `plan.md`, phase by phase. Each phase is a single chat session. Do not skip ahead.
- Mini Twenty is Sprint Zero's worked example (Phase 5). Until then, `examples/` is intentionally empty.

---

## Build orchestration pattern

Sprint Zero uses a two-tier pattern that respects Claude Code's sub-agent limitations:

- `tech-lead` is a **briefing sub-agent** — reads specs, returns a build brief, does NOT spawn engineers
- The **main Claude Code session** is the orchestrator — spawns backend-engineer and frontend-engineer in parallel, then qa-engineer after both complete, then security-engineer after QA
- `backend-engineer`, `frontend-engineer`, `qa-engineer`, `security-engineer` are **worker sub-agents** — isolated context, no sub-agent spawning themselves
- `security-engineer` always runs **last**, after `qa-engineer` — it pen-tests the build QA has already confirmed works and reports findings; it does not modify code

When running a build, invoke tech-lead first for the brief, then follow the recommended execution order it returns. Run security-engineer as the final step, after qa-engineer reports.
